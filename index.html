        <h2>Who are me?</h2>
        <p>I am 16 years old Boy. And i also like Programming, I study in class 11<sup>th</sup>. I have different types
            of hobbies like i like to play Cricket and I'm also like to edit videos, and more like video editing. On the
            other hand i like Programming to much just because i feel a different kind of fun in Programming, I like to
            study about Technology and i also have a Tech Youtube channel where i upload videos related about
            Programming and type of Tech. I feel that Programming was fun but when i start this my friends said,"That
            this is waste of time ". I start this adventure with my friends but slowly slowly my friends were giveup.
            And last year i am also giveup. But i giveup on the situation because the fee of these course are very High.
            But now i have a chance to grow me up. I went to S.M.I.T to fulfil my dreams. There are no fee but there are
            problem that i face, The S.M.I.T institude were very Far from my home about 20 km. And now I'm going with my
            new friend, I think Life is adventure And i also like adventure.
